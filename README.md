- Anonymous voting (one per person) and comments (optional display name)
- Anonymous post creation (stored with `visitorId`)
- Private dashboard: orgs/teams, projects, feedback, roadmap
- Multi-tenant RBAC (OWNER/ADMIN/MEMBER/VIEWER/BILLING)

## Routing

- Public:
  - `/[project]/feedback`
  - `/[project]/roadmap`
- Private (dashboard):
  - `/[org]/[project]/feedback` (single page; dialogs for new/detail)
  - `/[org]/[project]/roadmap`
  - `/[org]/settings/{profile,team,billing,projects,boards}`

## Local Development
